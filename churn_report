Customer Churn Analysis Report for Telecom Provider
Project Objective:
Analyze customer data to identify key drivers of churn and recommend actionable retention strategies.

1. Datasets Used:
Customer Records (15,000 rows): CustomerID, PlanType, MonthlyBill, Tenure, Churn, Complaints

Customer Interactions (20,000 rows): CustomerID, InteractionDate, InteractionType, IssueResolved

Demographic Data (15,000 rows): CustomerID, Age, Region, DeviceType


2. Data Preparation:
Merged datasets on CustomerID

Handled missing values:

Complaints: filled with median (1.0)

Region: filled with mode

Interaction data is missing due to many customers not contacting support

No negative values in MonthlyBill due to generation constraints

MonthlyBill outliers (~0.9%) observed but not treated as they appeared genuine

Feature Engineering:
ComplaintsGroup (None, Low, Medium, High)

MonthlyBillGroup (Low, Mid, High, Very High)

TenureGroup (<6M, 6-12M, 1-2Y, 2-5Y, 5Y+)

UnresolvedComplaints (TotalComplaints * (1 - IssueResolvedRate))

BillToTenure Ratio


3. Churn Driver Identification (Chi-Square Tests):
Feature	P-value	Significance
MonthlyBillGroup	3.70e-239	Strong
ComplaintsGroup	4.71e-166	Strong
TenureGroup	0.000	Strong
UnresolvedComplaints	5.67e-44	Strong
Insights:
Customers with High Monthly bills and High Complaints are highly likely to churn

Churn rate is 51% for customers with <6 months tenure

Engineered feature UnresolvedComplaints showed a strong correlation with churn


4. Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression with SMOTE):
Precision: 0.40

Recall: 0.55

F1-Score: 0.46

ROC AUC: 0.84

Confusion Matrix:             [[3370  510]
                                             [ 278  342]]
The model is capable of detecting churners with reasonable accuracy and excellent AUC, especially after balancing.

5. Recommendations:
Target high-paying, short-tenure customers with retention offers

Resolve support issues faster to lower the UnresolvedComplaint risk

Monitor and act on customers with multiple complaints quickly

Enhance onboarding for new customers (<6 months tenure)

Conclusion:
Churn is concentrated in customers with high complaints, unresolved issues, and short tenure. The model and statistical analysis together identified actionable churn drivers with confidence.

Tools Used: Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels), Faker for data generation, chi-square test, logistic regression with SMOTE
